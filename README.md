# Energy efficiency evaluation of services
This repository contains the results of the evaluation of the paper entitled "Automatic Evolution of Eco-Efficient Software
Architectures with CVL Models" submitted to the IEEE Latin America Transactions journal.

This includes the .csv files with the results of energy consumption for several services such as compression, encryption, logging, communication, monitoring, and caching. Also, the scripts used to estimate the energy are available.
